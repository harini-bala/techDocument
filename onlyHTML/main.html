        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>On<time datetime="06-18">18th June</time>5 world's rich people united to board a <abbr title="a small submersible boat or other craft, especially one designed for research and exploration.">submersible</abbr>.
            The ticket for the entry of this submersible is 2 crores per ticket.
            The journey of this submersible is to visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic"><abbr title="the largest ship afloat at the time"><mark>Titanic Ship</mark></abbr></a>,
            that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on <time datetime="1912-12">April 1912 </time> after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York City, United States.
            At present,Titanic ship is having its greatest sleep at 4km depth in the Atlantic Ocean.The rich people took this journey as a sport where the submersible should return to the surface in 8 hours after viewing the Titanic. 
            But,<time datetime="PT8H">8 hours</time> flied to <time datetime="PT12H">12 hours</time> and there is no response from those rich people.
            Then, the communication was lost. Suddenly, the world's headlines were the missing news of the world's rich people.For the last few weeks, the news channels from BBC to SunTv flashed this news. 
            What happened to these 5 people? Are they alive at this moment? 
            There was a news that the oxygen in the submersible might be depleted and the people might die. 
            What was the actual scene? How they were lost? Can we visit the Titanic? Why the ticket price is 2 crores? Will the rich people
            be rescued or survive?
            Is there any possibility for them to recreate the scenes of Pirates of the Caribbean movie? Is there any possibility for them to get buried?
            An awful incident. Let me explain that to you.

        <h2>Ocean Gate:</h2>
            <p>
                Mr. Rush who is the founder of the company called <mark>Ocean Gate</mark> had a great goal to achieve.
                He dreamed to become a pilot.He felt that there are more people to explore aviation like Elon Musk and Jeff.
                Mr Rush wished to explore the ocean.He started a company named OCEAN GATE.
                With this company, he started a mission called submersible Swim.
                Every wanderlust has the wish to explore that particular thing.
                The explorers were ready to spend more money to see the world's first shipwreck, which is nothing but our TITANIC.
                Ocean Gate company built a submersible ship.The submersible ship is built specifically to explore the Titanic.
            </p>

            <p>
                 Titanic sank in the North Atantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an ice berg during a voyage. After 100 years, the Titanic resting at a depth of 12,000 feet.
                 The comparison can be taken from Burj Kalifa which is 2000 feet tall. Just imagine the comparison between the 12,000 feet and the 2000 feet. The Titanic's depth is equivalent
                 to 6 Burj Kalifa under the ocean. At that depth, Titanic is resting.
                 The construction of a submariner is a costly business.
                 The privately owned submarines are up to only 100 in number. Why there aren't many submarines? The big countries are owning the submarines.
                 There are submarines for India.
                 And, the submarines are there for US and Germany.
                 Why an individual can't have a submarines?
                 The safety standards of the submarines are very high.
                 The sunlight will be stopped after travelling some distance in the ocean.
                 The ocean will be dark. We won't know the animals which are coming at you. 
                 Humans haven't explored much in Ocean. This is very dangerous.
                 For tackling this, Mr Rush built a submersible named Titan.
                 These titan submersible are very less in size compared to typical submarines.

            <p>
                Titan is a Cyclops-class manned submersible that was designed to take five people to the place under the ocean where Titanic ship is resting for more than a century. 
                This can accommodate up to 5 persons. Mr.Rush wished to launch this in 2019. 
                After the delay of COVID in 2020 and 2021, he did 6 successful attempts in exploring the Titanic with expertise.
                The part of the Atlantic where the Titanic is resting in a complicated territory. After a great delay, 
                Mr Rush announced to start the Titan exploration on June 18.3 people bought the tickets. 
                One of them is from French. And the rest of people are the richest person of Pakistan and his son. 
                And the rest two are a guide and a companion.

            <h2>Working of Titan:</h2>
            <p>
                These 5 rich people travelled in the mother ship.From that mother ship, there will be a small boat launched.This boat, launch the submersible to the point of Titanic.
                After the observation of Titanic, the mother ship will again pull the submersible back.
                Ocean Gate also simplifies this mechanism. The mechanism was used to reduce the cost of submersible. 
                Due to the heavy load of the submersible, the gravity pulled the submarined down.
                After entering into the depth of Ocean, the ocean gate uses the mechanism of creating an air space by removing the water jam.
                This is the simple mechanism followed by Ocean Gate. The place for the 5 people in titan submersible is like a tube. The tubes resemble our drainage tubes. 
                The submersible was operated by Joystick.
                I'm not even kidding, The owner of Ocean Gate controls of the submersible by the joystick.  
                Mr Rush's goal is to have a Titanic explore in Ocean at a cheap price.
                The depth is unimaginable where the exploration can't be achieved by the scuba divers themselves. We can't bear the pressure at that depth.
                And, death can occur due to the pressure

            <h2>Overview of Incident:</h2>
            <p>
                With this, the 5 members dropped into the ocean on June 18. Within 1.30 hours, the communication between the submersible and the mother ship was lost. 
                We all would have thought while  we can escape from a jungle trap with a GPS. 
                But, why we can't repeat the same in the ocean. The GPS won't work under the ocean. We knew about the SONAR technology usage in the ocean. With Sound waves, the SONAR works. 
                But, we can get information from sound waves only up to a certain depth of the ocean. 
                So, SONAR can't be effective. The communication was made by a text message from the mother ship to the submersible which is under the water. With that text messages, 
                the submersible is operated. Due to a drop in communication from Mother ship, the whole communication between the submersible and mother ship was 
                lost within 1.40 hours after the launch. But the company is a fishy company. The company was not  following the whole safety standards. Of course, Ocean Gate can't follow all the security protocols.
                The Wright brothers didn't follow any safety methods for their first ride.
                The Wright brothers did their work because of their craze to fly. Like that, the ocean gate wished to enter the depth of the ocean. There was no safety mechanism. 
                The company's owner, Mr Rush also went underwater in the submersible. 
                The company's workers started complaining in the police, costal guards and army soldiers.
                The passengers are rich people. One person is the Ambani of Pakistan.
                And there are people from France and US. So, the workers of Oceangate waited for 8 hours. Generally, the submersible goes around the Titanic after dropping from the Mother ship. 
                After viewing the Titanic, the submersible goes up. 
                The Titanic is resting under the salt water for 100 years.
                Some of the parts of Titanic were seperated. So, it takes 8 hours for them to complete the exploration of Titanic. The 5 people haven't come 
                to the surface after 8 hours as the communication was disturbed within 1.5 hours.
            </p>
            <img src="img.jpg" alt="Titan_submissive" title="Titan_submissive" width="500" height="300" class="center">
            <p>
                After 8 hours, the Mothership alerted the coast guard.The Atlantic Ocean is an International waters. So, the rules set by the US or Canada won't be applied for the coast guard at this part of the ocean. 
                Because of the loophole in the rules only, Ocean Gate was able to do the exploration. The Canada and US should set security rules to the submarines, 
                if the place comes under their territory. 
                The part of that Atlantic Ocean is in International water. The US didn’t start the rescue procedure immediately and Canada too. 
                After knowing the people involved in this submersible, US and Canadian govt started the rescue mission. 
                The coast guard searched the ocean at the surface level. They can't search into the depth of Ocean because of the pressure. 
                Only certain ships can detect the depth with SONAR. 
                The same activity from a ship can't be done by a submersible. 
                people who all went under the ocean. It is known that there was a cut in the communication between Moter ship and Titan.
                What happened after this? Rescue team are in full force, searching the Titan submergible.

            <h2>What might be happened:</h2>
            <p>
                There are few news which state there was a heavy blast sound felt during that 1.40 hours. 
                The rescue days are increasing from 3 to 5. In the meantime of suspecting the death of the 5 rich people, there was an occurrence of SOS signal for the past 24 hours. 
                The Ocean Gate suspected that as an SOS. For every 30 mins, there was an occurrence of the bang sound. The rescue needs to be made by following the sound. 
                Now, the 5 people were going down. 
                What might happen to them? The rescue mission was ON for the 
                people. But what might happen to them? There are many possibilities that could occur to the 5 people in the submersible. Importantly, there might be 3 possibilities. 
                The first one is the blast 
                sound. Several machines detected the sound at time of the communication error. The detected blast might be this submersible's blast. 
                A submersible is a machine, right? It can blast due to the high pressure. 
                At the 1 hour and 40 minutes, the submersible might reach some considerable depth. 
                So, the people might die due to the blast. We are searching for the submersible's parts. 
                It is like searching for a needle in a haystack.
            </p>
            <p>
                The parts of the Titan submersible could be found on the ocean floor. It is very tough to search for the parts 
                as we found the Titanic only in the 1980s. We found the Titanic after 60 years of its drowning. It took many years to find the largest ship in the world. 
                Several searched for years about the Titanic parts. 
                Second possibility, The Titan submersible might be on the surface of the ocean after the communication error. There is a mechanism kept with this Titan submersible for safety purposes. 
                Sandbags were installed in this submersible. After 8 hours, the sands will be emptied. After the weight reduction, the submersible will come up. 
                With this simple mechanism, they might come up to the surface. 
                If they reached the surface at this time, the submersible can be spotted. But they haven't been spotted. The third possibility is 
                the worst-case scenario. This possibility shouldn't happen. This Titan submersible is a small one and have the size of this room. 
                If this Titan submersible got stuck within the Titanic ship while exploring the Titanic?If that is true, the 5 will have a slow death. As of today, the oxygen 
                tank will be emptied. There won't be oxygen for the 5 people. There is no possibility for the presence of Oxygen as we tend to inhale more 
                oxygen in our tense situation. There will be a great painful death for them. The people who went to explore 
                the Titanic might die within Titanic. If that's the scenario, the rescue of those 5 people will be delayed. 
                All three possibilities are very heart breaking. The hope went down to zero percent.
